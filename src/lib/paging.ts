// Reading a whole table past PostgREST's row cap.
//
// The shared Supabase project's API returns at most 1000 rows per request,
// whatever the client asks for: `.range(0, 49999)` comes back as a 206 with
// the first 1000 and no error. Transactions load newest-first, so at 1141 rows
// the oldest 141 (Feb 2022 - Jun 2023) silently vanished from every dashboard,
// and each import pushed another month of history off the end. Same helper as
// claude-ecosystem's packages/shared/src/paging.ts.
//
// Pass a function that runs the query for one inclusive row range; this keeps
// asking until a page comes back short. The query must have a total order
// (add a unique column as the final `.order`), or rows that tie on the sort key
// can shift between requests and be skipped or repeated at a page boundary.

/** The server's cap. A smaller page still works; a larger one would be cut to
